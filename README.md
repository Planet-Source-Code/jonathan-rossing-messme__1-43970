### Description

This is a small community instant messenger, I know there is sooooo many of them on psc but... this one is a bit different... it’s Server/client based with an multi-connection ability that allows up to two hundred peers to be connected to the server! (I downloaded the server/client from psc but forgot who made it... so if anyone recognizes the code... just let me know and ill give u some creeds in the code) It has animated smiles like yahoo and a login form that is controlled by the server... And it looks so sweeeet to =D (vote/comment)
